# Skills App

Simple app for tallying up hours of study/work, aim is to reach the legendary 10,000 hour mark of focused practice in your discipline of choice. I've tried to gamify this so that you can be more motivated and have a better understanding of what stage you are at in your trade.

## Getting Started

Clone or download the zip file into your directory and then run the SkillsGui.py script using python 3.

### Prerequisites

If it's not already installed on your computer, you can get the latest version of python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need tkinter, instructions for which are at http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html

And you will need the Shelf module, which is part of the python standard library and should already be available when you install python 3.

Pygame is also used, if you're on unix, you can run:

pip install pygame

or follow the instructions at https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
